## - Mission

the - project is created to support and help collaborate developers working on custom Android ROMs that 
don't have access to powerful enough computers to build [AOSP](https://source.android.com/) locally in a timely manner.

This repo provides powerful servers (sponsored by [Google Cloud Services](https://cloud.google.com))
configured and optimized for building AOSP fast.
